PROBLEM STATEMENT-
Not enough accessible energy generating resources available to the general public

IDEA
From the POV of a common indian neighbourhood. Community parks and playgrounds are where people come together to have fun, exercise, and most importantly, make productive use of their pent-up energy. Our team visualised this space where we can transform the energy people use while walking, and the energy that children use while playing.


PROTOTYPES AND REJECTED VERSIONS-
We discussed the ideas of mats stacked on piezoelectric sensors, a slide using dynamo mechanisms, a swing attatched to a gear system, a trampoline which using solenoids put in the trampolines springs and a see-saw using a dynamo. We made paper prototypes of the swing, trampoline and seesaw.
