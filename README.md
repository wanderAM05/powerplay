PROBLEM STATEMENT
Not enough accessible energy generating resources available to the general public

IDEA
From the POV of a common Indian neighbourhood. Community parks and playgrounds are where people come together to have fun, exercise, and most importantly, make productive use of their pent-up energy. Our team visualised this space where we can transform the energy people use while walking, and the energy that children use while playing.


PROTOTYPES AND REJECTED VERSIONS
We discussed the ideas of a swing attached to a generator and a see-saw with a dynamo. We made paper prototypes for both. The swing seemed impractical, so we decided to go with the see-saw. We first thought of adding two bidirectional turbines behind the backrest of the seesaw so that every time the seesaw moved up and down, the turbines would rotate and generate electricity. However, it was very inefficient to hit the turbines every time the seesaw moved and converting the bidirectional motion to unidirectional was difficult. We then decided to switch the idea to a car alternator connected to the axle, but the alternator needed much more force and rotation than we anticipated. 

FINAL PROJECT
Finally, we connected the seesaw to a cycle's gear system that allows rotation in one direction and converted the seesaw's oscillation to a unidirectional rotational motion without causing a lot of friction. Then we connected a smaller cylinder coated in rubber to the wheel of the cycle, to increase the rate per minute, and then attached a dynamo to the cylinder. Hence, when the see-saw oscillated in one direction, the pedal would move with it, spinning the cyclinder and hence the dynamo. When it moved in the other direction, it brought the pedal back to the original position,allowing the process to continue.



OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT
Build a stable see-saw
Create a mechanism that connects the axle of the see-saw to the pedal of the cycle
Acquire a system that helps to increase the RPM produced by the flywheel
Attach a dynamo to this system to generate upto 3V of electricity



MATERIALS REQUIRED
1 6' x 4' x 0.75" piece of plywood
1 1' PVC pipe
8 L-brackets
1 Dynamo
2 Jumper wires
1 Breadboard
1 LED
1 Cycle (for gear system)
1 Cycle stand (to attach RPM enhancement system)



ASSEMBLY AND DEBUGGING
To make the see saw we first started off by creating the mounting system for the plank. To do this we cut two rectangular pieces out and drilled a holw the same as the diameter of our PCV pipe 19 cm above the ground, which was the same height as the pivot point for the cycle pedals. Post this we used a dremel to increase the diameter of the hole a little bit since the pipe was not able to rotate freely. We attatched the mounting system to a large base piece of about 4 square feet. this was too light, hence we later had to attatch more weight to the base so that it remained grounded in a fixed position.

We then created the mechanism to attach the axle of the see-saw to the pedal of the bicycle, using a largecircle of 24cm radius cut out of plywood. We then again drilled ahole the size of the pcv pipe in the centre, and attatched two 20cm x 10cm pieces of plywood with 3 cm distance between them and the piece centres at a 17 cm distance from the centre of the circle. We fixed them on with two L barckets each, but the bottom one later required more fastening because it had to apply more pressure on the bedal, hence we applied two more L brackets to it.

We finally connected the mechanism to the axle with the help of a square piece of plywood that was first drilled into the circular mechanism and then into the axle (pvc pipe) so that the axle rotated along with the mechanism.

Finally we screwed on a 130cm x 19cm plank to the axle on top of the mounting system, to complete the see-saw.

To complete the system we mounted the cycle on top of the stand and connected a dynamo to the smaller cylinder on the stand using super-sticky putty.We connected the positive and negative ends of the dynamo to an LED, and hence the movement of the see-saw was converted to uni-directional motion and would light up the LED.
