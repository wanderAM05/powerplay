PROBLEM STATEMENT-
Not enough accessible energy generating resources available to the general public

IDEA
From the POV of a common Indian neighbourhood. Community parks and playgrounds are where people come together to have fun, exercise, and most importantly, make productive use of their pent-up energy. Our team visualised this space where we can transform the energy people use while walking, and the energy that children use while playing.


PROTOTYPES AND REJECTED VERSIONS-
We discussed the ideas of mats stacked on piezoelectric sensors, a slide using dynamo mechanisms, a swing attached to a generator, a trampoline using solenoids put in the trampoline's springs and a see-saw using a dynamo. We made paper prototypes of the swing, trampoline and seesaw. The swing, slide and trampoline made on a small scale in a short period of time seemed impractical, so we decided to go with the piezoelectric tiles and the see-saw. We first thought of adding two bidirectional turbines behind the backrest of the seesaw so that every time the seesaw moved up and down, the turbines would rotate and generate electricity. However, it was very inefficient to hit the turbines every time the seesaw moved and converting the bidirectional motion to unidirectional was difficult. We then decided to switch the idea to a car alternator connected to the axle, but the alternator needed much more force and rotation than we anticipated. 

FINAL PROJECT-
Finally, we connected the seesaw to a cycle's gear system that allows rotation in one direction and converted the seesaw's oscillation to a unidirectional rotation motion without causing a lot of friction. Then we connected a smaller cylinder coated in rubber to the wheel of the cycle, to increase the rate per minute, and then attached a dynamo to the cylinder.

For the mat, we used
